## About
This repo is a fork of [Nvdtn19's PvZ2C English translation server](https://github.com/Nvdtn19/nvdtn19.github.io/), used to host the translation file, simplified to just pushing raw file to the directory. The translation of this fork is being maintained by Nectarinna.

Translation for the game from forks is not the same when compared to original repo and each translation has its own advantages and drawbacks.
